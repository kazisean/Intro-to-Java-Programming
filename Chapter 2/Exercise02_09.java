 * (Physics: acceleration) Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity
	divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula:
	a = v1 - v0
	t
	Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/
	second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds,
	and displays the average acceleration.
