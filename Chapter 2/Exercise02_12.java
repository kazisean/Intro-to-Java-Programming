/*
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off 
 *  speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to 
 *   take off using the following formula:
 *                    v2
 *          length = ----
 *                    2a
 *  Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the 
 *  acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum run-
 *  way length.
