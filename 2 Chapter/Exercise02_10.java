/*
 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
	to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
	should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
	and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
	Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
	where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
	and energy Q is measured in joules.
