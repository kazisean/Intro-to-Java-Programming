        (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following
                                                2 * 2 system of linear equation:
		                                        ax + by = e   x = 	ed - bf	  y = af - ec
		                                        cx + dy = f       	ad - bc       ad - bc
                                                Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
				                            	3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
					                            2.1x + .55y = 5.9
